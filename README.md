# Password Generating App

## Description

I could not figure out how to write a proper code generator, so I was remotivated to take a second look at it after having a better understanding of Javascript and troubleshooting methods. I built it to prove to myself that I have learned a great deal since my first attempt. The app generates a random password for the user using the credentials that they desire. I learned that coding is definitely a marathon and not a sprint. Just looking at the time required for me to complete the second attempt compared to the first attempt illuminate this very strongly. I spent less than two hours writing the code in my second attempt, and I spent an embarassingly more amount of time despite not getting the code to work the first time.

## Installation

The only thing necessary would be a web browser to interpret the code.

## Usage

Follow the instructions given by the prompts then click the generate password button to create a copy-pastable password. If an answer besides "yes" or "Yes" is given it will default to not using that character selection.
